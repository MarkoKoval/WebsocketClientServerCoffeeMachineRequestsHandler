Problem:
I'm a lazy programmer (very lazy). I have to stand by the coffee machine and wait for the coffee to be brewed. So, as a lazy programmer, I have client-server scripts where the server part is deployed on the coffee machine and the client I run on my computer. Please note that our coffee machine has wi-fi. So from. I want to choose a drink with ingredients, send a request and as I go - the drink is preparing. I just have to pick up a drink and go smoke with him. I am very selfish, so I do not let others use the coffee machine, so I have no problems with the queue of people.
client1 and client2 are created to show that you get no coffee if another client is running 

USE PYTHON 3.6 AS INTERPRETER
